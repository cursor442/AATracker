Game tracker for Axis and Allies Global 1940

I graduated college in spring 2020 (yep, didn't get to walk at my own graduation) and started my job a month later. I decided to learn how to make a win32 app in the meantime and have been working on it off and on ever since.

I'm aware that no one will ever actually play the game with me, but I like operating under the illusion that my family will at least start a game if I have an app that larely keeps track of the rules for them. If just one person somewhere in the world actually uses this thing, I'd consider that an accomplishment.

While I am an engineer, I am not a software engineer. Therefore, I can write functional code but don't expect it to be terribly clean. Graphics design is not a strong suit either but I try. Does not help that I am a bit color blind. That's fine for now because I don't intend/expect anyone else to work on this. Would be cool if someone wanted to help though.

This app is intended to replace any notepad or spreadsheet someone might use to track IPCs in an Axis and Allies 1940 2nd Edition game. It is intended to work for Europe, Pacific, or Global, but I test more for the Global version. It is capable of graphing various game statuses, has a built-in game log, and save/load functionality. The idea is to make it easier for novice players to keep track of the game phases, how many purchases they can make, when they can declare war, etc. Advanced players may like the graphs and log for post-game analysis. 

My ultimate dream is to get this to a state where you could reasonably use it for a game without the basic status tracking bugging out or the app crashing. If I ever get there, I'll put a post up on r/AxisAllies or something asking if people would be interested in it. There's nothing I'd love more than a flood of bug reports from actual players.
